In some embodiments, a three-dimensional matrix is developed by stacking of volumetric data and the bony structure is segmented through thresholding. Initially a seed point is searched for initializing the process of landmark detection. Two three-dimensional distance vectors are used to define and obtain the Volume of Interest (VOI). First 3-D distance vector helps to identify Empirical Point and consecutively second gives dimensions of the VOI. Three-dimensional contours of anatomical structure are traced in the estimated VOI. Cephalometric landmarks are identified on the boundaries of traced anatomical geometry, based on corresponding Mathematical Entities. Detected landmark can be used as a Reference Point for further detection of landmarks. Estimating the VOI and detection of points continues till all desired landmarks are detected. The detection procedure gives three-dimensional coordinate locations of the landmarks.
